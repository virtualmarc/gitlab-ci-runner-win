Gitlab CI Runner for Windows
============================

This is an unofficial runner for [Gitlab CI](https://github.com/gitlabhq/gitlab-ci) under Windows.

Requirements
------------

This program only runs under Windows operating systems.

For Linux operating systems, take a look at the [official runner for linux](https://github.com/gitlabhq/gitlab-ci-runner).

The following programs are needed:

[msysgit](http://msysgit.github.io/) (Install with openssh style ssh key support, not with putty keys)

Don't forget to add the `git/bin` directory (usually `C:\Program Files\Git\bin`) to your `PATH` variable!

Installation
------------

Just checkout this repository, open the project in Visual Studio 2013 and compile it yourself.

The configuration initialization begins on the first run.

After the first run the config is written and you can start the runner in the background.

To register the runner as service try the [NSSM](http://nssm.cc/). But remember to run the service as the user you created the config with!

Options
-------

If your CI server is using a self-signed certificate you can add -sslbypass option in argument
